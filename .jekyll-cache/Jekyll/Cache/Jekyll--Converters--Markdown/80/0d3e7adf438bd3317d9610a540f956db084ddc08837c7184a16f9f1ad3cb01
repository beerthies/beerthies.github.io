<p>For this research, I used 2 datasets. The first one was downloaded by Learn Java Coding himself from Instagram. If you want to do that too, click <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-download-all-your-instagram-data/">here</a>. That data set contained several json files. I used comments.json and likes.json. The second data set was obtained by <a href="https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/">scraping</a> information from instagram.com/learnjavacoding. 
Because the main question is relatively broad, I started exploring immediately. Of course, I was interested which accounts were liked the most by my friend. You can see that on the right. As you can see, he likes a lot of his fellow code-Insta-users. Also, he seems to be into hiphop, since he likes 50cent and spec.nl (a Dutch management agency for artists). <br />

<p>Having taken at look at the likes that he gives, it is also interesting to see <em>when</em> he likes the most. In the bar plot on the left, you can see that he is kind of a night owl. Also, there is a peek during lunch break. It is funny to see a drop during dinner time. Apparantly, he does not use Insta then that much.<br />

<p>Being busy with time and likes, it was logical to have a look at his activity on Instagram over the years. On the right you can see the last 1.5 years of his usage of Instagram. You can see a peek in the summer of 2018, after which it has been relatively quiet.<br />

<p>Some KPIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>309 likes on one day.</li>
  <li>42 likes per day on average.</li>
  <li>464 active days in the last 1.5 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Up till now, we have looked at the likes that Learn Java Coding has given to other Insta accounts. However, it is also interesting to have a look at his comments. Which accounts get the most of his comments? As you can see on the most right bar plot, those are mainly fellow code-Insta-users.
It is also interesting to see which accounts are tagged the most by LJC (left graph). The blue bar indicates that he has 1 very close friend who gets tagged 8 times more than the second most tagged account. That is interesting.<br />

<p>Finally, it is interesting to have a look at where every post has been posted. As you know, every Instagram post can have a location attached to it (given by the user). I scraped that data from instagram.com/learnjavacoding and plotted that in a heatmap, which you can see on the right. As you can see, Amsterdam is red. This means that a lot of posts are from there. However, Paris, Monaco and Marseille are all green. This shows that LJC has also been there.<br />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Since this research was relatively small, it is a bit redundant to give a conclusion and indicate liabilities. This project was more for fun. Thank you for reading it! If you are interested, I have done some more projects as well. If you are interested in learning Java, I would recommend you to have a look at his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/learnjavacoding/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://learnjavacoding.com">website</a>.</p>
